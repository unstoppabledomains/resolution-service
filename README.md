Resolution service provides an API for getting domain data and metadata
regardless of that domain's location (whether it is stored in Ethereum, Zilliqa,
or any other blockchain). The service is used to cache blockchain events in a
database for easy retrieval without acessing blockchain APIs.

The resolution service is provided as a docker image so it can be launched on a
variety of platforms and in the cloud.

## Resolution service endpoints
- Production: http://resolve.unstoppabledomains.com/api-docs/

## Installation

### Pre-requirements

- **git** - to clone the repository.
- **docker** - to run the service. Install docker by following
  [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for an appropriate
  system.
- **postgres** - to store the data. Postgres can be configured on the same
  server as the resolution service or on a dedicated database hosting (e.g. AWS
  RDS, Google Cloud SQL). To install postgres locally, follow these
  [instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/download). Make sure to configure
  password authentication for the DB user that will be used by the service.

### Quick start

1. Clone the resolution-service repository\
   `git clone https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-service.git`
2. Build the docker container\
   `docker build -t resolution-service .`
3. Setup environment variables\
   Create a file `service.env` that will contain required environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
RESOLUTION_POSTGRES_HOST=example.com:5432   # DB host
RESOLUTION_POSTGRES_USERNAME=example        # DB user configured in postgres
RESOLUTION_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password       # DB password configured in postgres
ETHEREUM_JSON_RPC_API_URL=https://infura.io # Address of a JSON RPC provider. This can be a public API (e.g. infura), or a local ethereum node with JSON RPC enabled
VIEWBLOCK_API_KEY=apikey                    # key for Viewblock API, required for getting data from Zilliqa blockchain
```

This is the minimum required set of configurations for the service. Additional
configuration options are listed in
[Environment configuration options](README.md#environment-configuration-options).

4. Setup postgres database.
   - Connect to a postgres instance using the psql console\
     `psql --host=HOSTNAME --username=USERNAME`
   - Create the `resolution_service` database\
     `createdb resolution_service`
5. Launch the service\
   `docker run -d --env-file service.env -p 3000:3000 --network="host" resolution-service`

> ℹ️ By default, the service will use a snapshot of a synchronized database to
> seed domain data. If you want to synchronize blockchain data from scratch, add
> `RUNNING_MODE=API,ETH_WORKER,ZIL_WORKER,MIGRATIONS` to the `service.env` file.

## Running the service

Once the service is started, it will perform initial synchronization with the
blockchain networks. It may take more than 24 hours for a full synchronization.
To speed up the process, a snapshot of the database is provided by Unstoppable
domains:
[PostgreSQL dump](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-service/blob/master/resolution_service.dump).
The snapshot is loaded by default using the `LOAD_SNAPSHOT` running mode (see
[Running modes](README.md#running-modes)). During the initial synchronization
the API may not work reliably. The status of synchronization can be checked
using the `/status` endpoint. After the synchronization is complete, the service
API endpoints can be accessed normally. Note that the service is stateless, so
the container doesn't need any persistent storage. All data is stored in the
database.

### Running modes

The service provides several running modes. By default it will run all of them.
However, the modes that will be used can be selected during startup using the
RESOLUTION_RUNNING_MODE environment variable. Available running modes:

- **API** - Runs the service API.
- **ETH_WORKER** - Runs the ETH worker to sync data from the Ethereum CNS and
  UNS registry
- **ZIL_WORKER** - Runs the ZIL worker to sync data from the Zilliqa ZNS
  registry
- **MIGRATIONS** - Runs the migration scripts if necessary.
- **LOAD_SNAPSHOT** - Loads the snapshot data from `/resolution_service.dump`

For example, to run only the `API` with the `ETH_WORKER`, the following
environment configuration can be used:

```
RESOLUTION_RUNNING_MODE=API,ETH_WORKER
```

### API keys

The `/domains` API requires an API key which is simply a version 4 UUID. Currently there are no key management functions in the resolution service. All API keys must be added manually using the database. To generate a random API key run the following query in postgres:

``` sql
 INSERT INTO api_keys (name, api_key) VALUES ('my API key', md5(clock_timestamp()::text)::uuid);
```

> Note: The above example should not be used for production API keys as the key which is based on a predictable value. Production keys should be generated externally.

## API reference

The full api reference
[OpenAPI specification](http://resolve.unstoppabledomains.com/api-docs/)

| Endpoint                 | Description                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| GET /domains             | Gets the list of domains.                    |
| GET /domains/:domainName | Gets the resolution of the specified domain. |
| GET /status              | Gets the synchronization status.             |
| GET /api-docs            | Returns a swagger documentation page.        |

> Note: The `/domains` endpoints require an API key. The key must be provided as `Bearer` authentication header for requests. New keys must be added manually to the database (see [API keys](#api-keys) for more info).

## Development notes

### Database schema changes

To change database schema (adding new migrations) you have to create a new
database dump with new database schema. In order to do this please follow the
next steps:

1. Run `yarn db:snapshot:load` command to restore database from the dump
   (`resolution_service.dump`). If command fails - re-create local database and
   try again.
2. Create new migrations: `yarn db:migration:sync` or `yarn db:migration:new`
   **IMPORTANT: make sure that you don't remove any data in the new migrations -
   avoid `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE` SQL commands.**
3. Apply new migrations to the database filled with dump data.
4. Create a new dump using `yarn db:snapshot:create`
5. Check snapshot using: `yarn db:snapshot:check`

### Development pre-requirements

The dev. environment has generally the same pre-requirements as running the
service normally. So, postgres and docker are also necessary. For convenience
postgres configuration can be the same as defaults (username - postgres,
password - secret).

Additional pre-requirements that are necessary for development:

- Node.JS 14.16.1\
  Can be installed using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

### Running in dev. mode

1. Install project dependencies

```
nvm use 14.16.1
yarn install
```

2. Configure environment variables.\
   The required variables are the same as running the service in docker. To simplify
   development it's recommended to set additional ENV variables mentioned in `./local.dev.env`
   file.

```
RESOLUTION_POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
RESOLUTION_POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
RESOLUTION_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
RESOLUTION_POSTGRES_DATABASE=password
ETHEREUM_JSON_RPC_API_URL=localhost
VIEWBLOCK_API_KEY=apikey
```

3. Run the service

```
yarn start:dev
```

### Running unit tests

> Make sure you've started Ethereum emulator before running the tests:
> `yarn ganache-cli`

Unit tests can be run using `yarn test`. This command will run the tests with
ENV variables set in `./local.test.env` file. You could redefine any env
variable in yours local environment if needed, for example:
`export RESOLUTION_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password`. Testing command will take this
variable first instead of using variable from `./local.test.env` file.

For checking coverage use `yarn test:coverage`.

Unit/integration tests use a postgres database that is cleaned before each test.
By default, the database name is `resolution_service_test`.

### Service architecture

![Architecture chart](doc/ResolutionService.png)

The service currently consists of three main components: API, and two workers.
The API component is a basic HTTP API that allows reading domain data from the
database. The OpenAPI specification:
[OpenAPI specification](http://resolve.unstoppabledomains.com/api-docs/).

Currently there are two workers in the resolution service:

- ETH worker\
  Contains a scheduled job that connects to the Ethereum blockchain using JSON RPC
  and pulls CNS (.crypto) and UNS domains and resolution events. The events are parsed
  and saved to the database.
- ZIL worker\
  Contains a scheduled job that connects to the Zilliqa blockchain using and pulls
  ZNS (.zil) domains and resolution events. The events are parsed and saved to the
  database.

More workers may be added in the future.

### Logs and monitoring

The resolution service outputs logs to `stdout` so they are available by
`docker logs` and can be monitored by cloud tools (e.g. AWS CloudWatch or Google
Cloud Logging). The general log format should be:
`<timestamp> <log level>: <Component label> - <Log message>`

The resolution service has a configurable logging level. Log messages are at
consistent levels across the whole service. We use the following guidelines to
determine logging level: Event|Component|description|log level
-----|---------|-----------|--------- Startup info|all|Log any startup
information (e.g. worker is starting, API is listening)|info Sync
progress|Workers|Log current sync progress of a worker (which blocks are being
processed, how many blocks are left to process)|info Handled errors|all|Log any
errors that can be handled gracefully (e.g. a malformed request that will return
a 400 error)|warn Unhandled errors|all|Log any errors that were captured by
top-level error handlers (e.g. an unexpected third-party API error, invalid db
state)|error API Request|API controllers|Log any request to the API with their
parameters|debug DB query|all|Log any db queries with their parameters|debug
Parsed event|Workers|Log any event or transaction parsed by the worker|debug
External API calls|all|Log external API calls|debug

Additionally, if the appropriate keys are provided in the environment
configuration, the service will report errors to monitoring tools. The
resolution service has integrations with [bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) and
[newrelic](https://newrelic.com/).
